\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

All algorithms suitable to heterogeneous systems containing CPUs and GPUs. BPM has worst efficiency.

Bidirectional algorithms penalized in outdoor scenes.

VCM and BPM overhead when reflected caustics not present.

Only a small set of DICE features used.

DICE has full C++ generic interface. Easy enough to use and learn.

Scheduler learing robust to handle workload distribution and maximizes efficiency.

Future work: try to adapt code to multi-GPU and develop for Xeon Phi.
