Physically based rendering is an unsolved challenge, as there are many efficient light transport algorithms, although none is robust enough to handle every possible situation, lighting and scene configuration. The performance of such techniques can be enhanced using two different approaches: more efficient and robust algorithms and a better use of all available computing resources. Although most modern computers have both powerfull multicore CPU devices coupled to manycore GPU devices, most current implementations of light transport algorithms only address one of these types of computing units. This dissertation work addresses these efficiency issues by evaluating the most recent global illumination algorithms based on path space integration, using the DICE framework for heterogeneous (CPU + GPU) parallel systems. The results from our scalability test on such heterogeneous computing platforms show promising results and a path worth pursuing.
