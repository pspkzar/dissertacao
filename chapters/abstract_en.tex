Physically based rendering is an unsolved challenge, as there are many efficient light transport algorithms, although none is robust enough to handle every possible situation, lighting and scene configuration. The performance of such techniques can be enhanced using two different approaches: more efficient and robust algorithms and the use of more computational power. Although most modern computers have both powerful CPUs and GPUs, most current implementations of light transport algorithms only take advantage of one of these processors. Some of the most recent global illumination algorithms, based on path space integration, are evaluated using the DICE framework for heterogeneous (CPU + GPU) parallel systems, and very promising scalability results are demonstrated.
