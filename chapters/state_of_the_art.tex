\section{Path Tracing}

One of the first solution to the global ilumination was introduced by \cite{Kajiya} when he defined the problem of rendering as the resolution of an integral equation, also know as the rendering equation.

\begin{equation}
I(x,x')=g(x,x')[e(x,x')+\int_{S}^{} \rho(x,x',x'')I(x',x'')dx'']
\label{eq:render_eq}
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{tabular}{r l}
$I(x,x')$ & is related to the intensity of light passing from point $x$ to $x'$ \\
$g(x,x')$ & is the geometric term \\
$e(x,x')$ & is related to the intensity of emited light from $x$ to $x'$ \\
$\rho(x,x',x'')$ & is related to the intensity of light scattered from $x''$ to $x$ through $x'$\\

\end{tabular}
